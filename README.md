# README
## ManifoldEM Python Suite

This repository contains the Python software implementation of ManifoldEM for determination of conformational continua of macromolecules from single-particle cryo-EM data, as was first introduced by Dashti, et al. (2014). A detailed user manual is provided on the main branch of this repository. Carefully going through this manual will prepare you for running ManifoldEM on your own data sets. If you have any questions about ManifoldEM after reading this entire document, carefully check the ManifoldEM GitHub forum for similar inquiries or, if no similar posts exist, create a new thread detailing your inquiry. 

This software was developed in the Frank research group at Columbia University (https://joachimfranklab.org). The following resources may prove useful for a review of ManifoldEM history, theory and implementations:
