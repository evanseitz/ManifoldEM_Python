## ManifoldEM

This repository contains the Python software implementation of ManifoldEM for determination of conformational continua of macromolecules from single-particle cryo-EM data, as was first introduced by Dashti, et al. (2014). A detailed user manual is provided on the main branch of this repository, which will serve as a guide to using the ManifoldEM software suite on user-obtained data sets. As well, the following resources may prove useful for a review of ManifoldEM history, theory and implementations:
